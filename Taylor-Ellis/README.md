##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I referenced the general guidelines outlined in the 301 SMACCSSify Exercise readme. Basically working from the most broad in the base, to the most specific in the modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not, it seemed to be pretty efficient already but I may be wrong. In filtering through the css I didn't find any patterns in things that had the same styling that could be grouped together tidier. I think breaking it up into smaller files like this definitely makes it easier to go through for refactoring though. It is much harder to find patterns and simularities between elements when it is in one massive file and not organized as well.
