##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?
I used base rule to main website element like body and the star selector for the font family.In base.css we include broadest styling for example for the entire page.
I used layout rules for HTML elements like nav,footer,header,aside.As we go from base to next we will inculde more specific stylings.
I used module rule for element with id and classes.All the list items will go in here.


##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didnt refractor the existing css.
