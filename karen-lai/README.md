##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?


I re-organized the CSS based off of the general guidelines in the lab instructions. I basically look at the CSS selector names / types and moved them accordingly.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, it seems to work fine as it does. Didn't look at it in too great detail.
