##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Tried to follow the rule that slyling should progress from general to specific

base.css
main elements body, main, 
rules applied directly to element through element selector not specific class or ID selector.

layout.css
major layout components. nav, header, footer, classes and id

module.css
reusable elements,
minor componets list items, paragraphs. componets inside other components

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

no refactoring was necessary
