##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

base.css: Not much here. I had more but decided to move it (h2 and input) to modules. * and body selectors and google font import.

layout.css: margins, floats, padding, etc. No descendant selectors.

modules.css: the details. classes, descendant selectors. Actually it seems like there's too much in this file but then the devil's in the details...

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No. (Are you kidding!) If it works, don't fix it.  :o)
