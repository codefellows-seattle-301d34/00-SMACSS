##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I followed the general guidelines listed in the README as closely as I could. In general, I went from broadest rules (base css) to the narrowest rules (layout.css). 

I placed the import, * and body tags in base.css.
I placed the selectors for classes and individual selectors in layout.css.
I placed the rest (IDs and descending selectors) in modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor any of the existing CSS.
