##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

If it affected the entire page or all of something on the entire page, I put it in the base.css page.

If it affected the layout on the page or refered to the parent class or id, I put it in the layout.css.

All other items I put on the modules.css page.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No
