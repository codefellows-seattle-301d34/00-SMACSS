##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)
I basically asked myself -- does it affect a major font or the background ?  If yes, base.
Else if - does it affect how the entire page is displayed ?  If yes, layout.
Else if - does it affect a portion of the page displayed ?  If yes, module.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did no refactoring.  It was 12:13p by the time I finished and I still have CodeWars & finishing ES6 to do.
