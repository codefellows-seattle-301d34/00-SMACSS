##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

In general:
  Styling that applied to the entire site, such as fonts/background colors/margins was moved into base.css.

  Styling that applied to only large sections of the site, like nav bars/header/footer, was moved into layout.css.

  Styling that applied to only the smallest elements of the site, like images/time/date, was moved into modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor anything, but if I had it would have been in order to be able to better differentiate the which aspect of the code the styling applied to.
