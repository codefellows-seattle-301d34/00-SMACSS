##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

It felt fairly natural- the base was rules that applied to everything, the layout fixed main elements of the page, and the modules were the little details. It's a pretty harmonious system and will make finding/fixing css easier and more organized for sure!

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not! Everything seemed to work well together and I was a little crunched for time, oops
